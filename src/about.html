                    We apply vinyl back on mirrors for safety purposes, which
                    makes them maximum impact-resistant. In case of integrity
                    damage, such a layer keeps the pieces and prevents their
                    shattering around the room. All our products meet Australian
                    standards AS/NZS 2208:1996 as determined by AS1288:2006 and
